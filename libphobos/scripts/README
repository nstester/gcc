The D language scripts in this directory are used during the syncing of
libphobos with upstream.  They can be built with the command:

    dub build --single name-of-script.d

Or when dub isn't available:

    gdc -o name-of-script name-of-script.d [any other dependencies].d

Scripts:

gen_druntime_sources.d

    Generates source file definitions for libphobos/libdruntime/Makefile.am.
    Ran from the libdruntime directory and append output to Makefile.am.

    Example:

	cd libdruntime && ../scripts/gen_druntime_sources >> Makefile.am

gen_phobos_sources.d

    Generates source file definitions for libphobos/src/Makefile.am.  Ran from
    the libphobos/src directory and append output to Makefile.am.

    Example:

	cd src && ../scripts/gen_phobos_sources >> Makefile.am
